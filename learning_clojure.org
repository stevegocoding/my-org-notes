- Reducing Function

The kind of functions you'd pass to 'reduce' - it takes 2 args: the
result so far and a new input.

;;reducing function signature
whatever, input -> whatever


- Reducing Function Transformer (Transducer)

The kind of functions that takes a reducing function and returns
another one.

;;transducer signature
(whatever, input -> whatever) -> (whatever, input -> whatever)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defn mapping [f]
    (fn [f1]
      (fn [result input]
        (f1 result (f input)))))

  (defn filtering [pred]
    (fn [f1]
      (fn [result input]
        (if (pred input)
          (f1 result input)
          result))))

  (defn mapcatting [f]
    (fn [f1]
      (fn [result input]
        (reduce f1 result (f input)))))
#+END_SRC

- Powers of Transducers
  - The 'job' being done (what the reducing function does)
  - The context of use
  - The source of input


- Compose Transducers
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (comp (map double) (map inc))

  (map inc) =>
  (fn [f1]
      (fn [result input]
          (f1 result (inc input))))

  (map double) =>
  (fn [(map inc)]
      (fn [result input]
          ((map inc) result (double input)))))


  (comp (map double) (map inc))

  =>

  (fn [result (double input)]
      (f1 result (inc (double input))))   ; f1 is the reducing function (like conj or '+')  when we call the composed function
#+END_SRC

-> double THEN inc


**** Transducers in core.async

*** Java Interop

*** Compilation and Class Generation

**** On-the-fly Compilation

**** Ahead-of-time Compilation

- To deliver your application without source
- To speed up application startup
- To generate named classes for use by Java
- To create an application that does not need runtime bytecode generation and custom classloaders

**** Extending/Implementing Java Classes

- proxy
- reify
- gen-class
