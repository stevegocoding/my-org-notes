** Notes for Exam

*** Chapter 6: Using Single-Row functions


*** Chapter 7: Reporting Aggregated Data Using the Group Functions

**** Use of Group Functions

+ Aggregate functions can be called from 4 places in a SELECT
  statement: select list, ORDER BY clause, GROUP BY clause and HAVING
  clause; they do not exist in other SQL statement.

+ COUNT only counts non-NULL values and ignore NULL values.

+ COUNT(*) will count all rows, even there is NULL values in that
  row.

+ COUNT(DISTINCT last_name) => no duplicates, COUNT(ALL last_name) =>
  with duplicates. They CANNOT be used with the asterisk.

+ MIN/MAX can work with numeric, date and character data, same basic
  logic that ORDER BY uses for the different datatypes: '2' > '10'

+ AVG only works with numeric data, it ignors NULL values.

+ AVG can be used with DISTINCT and ALL

+ MEDIAN ignores NULL value.

+ RANK(c1, c2, c3) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY e1, e2, e3): c1 should match
  the datatype of e1, c2 should match the datatype of e2 ...

**** Group Data by Using the GROUP BY Clause

+ GROUP BY can specify any number of valid expressions, including
  columns of the table

+ With GROUP BY clause, the only items allowed in the select list of
  a SELECT are: 
  + expressions specified by the GROUP BY
  + aggregate functions

+ Expressions that are specified in the GROUP BY do not have to be
  included in the SELECT statement’s select list.

**** Filter Grouped rows by Using the HAVING clause

*** Chapter 8: Display Data from Multiple Tables
*** Chapter 9: Subquery

+ Subqueries can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and CREATE
  TABLE or CREATE VIEW.
+ Subquery can be used in WHERE clauses of SELECT, UPDATE and
  DELETE, in the UPDATE ... SET clause and INSERT list of values.
+ Subquery is a SELECT statement that may return one or more columns
  in one or more rows, multi-rows subquery must be used with IN, NOT
  IN, ANY and ALL.
+ Correlated subqueries can be used in SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE
  statement.
+ Scalar subquery expressions CANNOT be used in the following
  locations:
  + in CHECK constraint
  + in GROUP BY clauses
  + in HAVING clauses
  + in a function-based index
  + as a DEFAULT clause of any DML statement
  + in the WHEN conditions of CASE
  + in the START WITH and CONNECT BY clauses
+ Correlated subquery: 
  + each row, execute parent query and then subquery. Parent query
    drives correlated subquery.
  + Correlated subquery in UPDATE and DELETE clauses
    + in SET and WHERE clauses
+ EXIST keyword: tests for the existence of any rows in a subquery.
+ WITH clause: assign a name to a subquery block (internally a
  temporary table or inline view).

*** Chapter 10: Creating Ohter Schema Objects

**** Create and Use Simple and Complex Views

**** Create, Maintain, and Use Sequence
+ You cannot invoke CURRVAL in your first reference to a sequence
  within a given session. NEXTVAL must be the first reference.
+ If you attempt to execute a statement, such as an INSERT, that
  includes the sequence reference NEXTVAL, the sequence generator will
  advance to the next number even if the INSERT statement fails.
+ You cannot invoke CURRVAL or NEXTVAL in the DEFAULT clause of a
  CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement.
+ You cannot invoke CURRVAL or NEXTVAL in the subquery of a CREATE
  VIEW statement, nor of a SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
+ In a SELECT statement, you cannot combine CURRVAL or NEXTVAL with a
  DISTINCT operator.
+ You cannot invoke CURRVAL or NEXTVAL in the WHERE clause of a SELECT
  statement.
+ You cannot use CURRVAL or NEXTVAL in a CHECK constraint.
+ You cannot combine CURRVAL or NEXTVAL with the set operators UNION, INTERSECT, or MINUS.
+ You can call a sequence pseudocolumn from anywhere within a SQL
  statement that you can use any expression.

**** Create and Maintain Indexes
+ An INDEX is an object you can create in the database that supports
  faster queries on tables. For a given table, the INDEX stores a set
  of presorted data from one or more columns that you designate. Also
  stored in the INDEX is the address of data from the source table.
+ SQL can use the INDEX object to speed up querying of WHERE and ORDER
  BY clauses.
+ If a PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraint created, SQL will
  automatically create an index to support that constraint on the
  column or columns.
+ Single-column, composite and unique index

**** Create Private and Public Synonyms

*** Manage Schema Objects

**** Add and Modify Columns
+ ALTER TABLE statement is a DDL statement => implicit commit

**** Adding Constraints

**** Create Indexes Using the CREATE TABLE statement

**** Perform FLASHBACK operations

*** Set Operators

+ Rules for SELECT statement to combine:
  + number of expressions selected in the select list must be
    identical.
  + the datatypes of each expression mush match
  + Large datatypes such as BLOB and CLOB cannot be used
  + The ORDER BY clause cannot be included in the SELECT statements—
    except for the final SELECT statement.

*** Generating Reports by Grouping Related Data

**** Use ROLLUP Operation to Produce Subtotal Values

+ ROLLUP returns a single summary row for each grouped set of records
  within a SELECT statement that uses the GROUP BY clause.

+ For every n groups, ROLL UP produces n+1 groupings

**** Use the CUBE operation to produce Crosstabulation Values

+ CUBE is something of a three-dimensional ROLLUP. 
+ For n expressions, CUBE returns 2 to nth power groupings

**** Use the GROUPING function to identify the row values created by ROLLUP or CUBE

+ it differentates betweeen regular rows and superaggregate rows.

**** Use GROUPING SETS to produce a single result set

** Topics need to be reviewed

*** Using DDL to Create and Manage Tables
+ CREATE TABLE
+ ALTER TABLE
  + table level vs row level
  + add constraint: primary key using existing unique index 


*** Controlling User Acess
+ CANNOT combine system privileges and objects privileges in a single
  GRANT statement


*** Managing Schema Objects

**** Perform FLASHBACK operation

**** Create Indexes

**** External Tables
+ Only SELECT, no other DML
+ No index can be used

*** Manipulating Data

**** Control Transactions

***** SAVEPOINT and ROLLBACK 
+ when a commit issued (explicitly or implicitly), ALL save points will
be erased from memory, any references to save points will produce
errors



*** Manipulating Large Set of Data

**** Track the Change of data over period of time
+ versions_operation
+ versions_endtime

**** MERGE statement 
DML

*** Managing Objects with Data Dictionary Views

**** Query various data dictionary views

*** Set Operators

**** UNION
+ ORDER BY can only be used at the end of last statement

*** Create Other Schema Objects

**** Views
