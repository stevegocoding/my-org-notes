** Notes for Exam

*** Chapter 6: Using Single-Row functions


*** Chapter 7: Reporting Aggregated Data Using the Group Functions

**** Use of Group Functions

+ Aggregate functions can be called from 4 places in a SELECT
  statement: select list, ORDER BY clause, GROUP BY clause and HAVING
  clause; they do not exist in other SQL statement.

+ COUNT only counts non-NULL values and ignore NULL values.

+ COUNT(*) will count all rows, even there is NULL values in that
  row.

+ COUNT(DISTINCT last_name) => no duplicates, COUNT(ALL last_name) =>
  with duplicates. They CANNOT be used with the asterisk.

+ MIN/MAX can work with numeric, date and character data, same basic
  logic that ORDER BY uses for the different datatypes: '2' > '10'

+ AVG only works with numeric data, it ignors NULL values.

+ AVG can be used with DISTINCT and ALL

+ MEDIAN ignores NULL value.

+ RANK(c1, c2, c3) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY e1, e2, e3): c1 should match
  the datatype of e1, c2 should match the datatype of e2 ...

**** Group Data by Using the GROUP BY Clause

+ GROUP BY can specify any number of valid expressions, including
  columns of the table

+ With GROUP BY clause, the only items allowed in the select list of
  a SELECT are: 
  + expressions specified by the GROUP BY
  + aggregate functions

+ Expressions that are specified in the GROUP BY do not have to be
  included in the SELECT statement’s select list.

**** Filter Grouped rows by Using the HAVING clause

*** Chapter 8: Display Data from Multiple Tables
*** Chapter 9: Subquery

+ Subqueries can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and CREATE
  TABLE or CREATE VIEW.
+ Subquery can be used in WHERE clauses of SELECT, UPDATE and
  DELETE, in the UPDATE ... SET clause and INSERT list of values.
+ Subquery is a SELECT statement that may return one or more columns
  in one or more rows, multi-rows subquery must be used with IN, NOT
  IN, ANY and ALL.
+ Correlated subqueries can be used in SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE
  statement.
+ Scalar subquery expressions CANNOT be used in the following
  locations:
  + in CHECK constraint
  + in GROUP BY clauses
  + in HAVING clauses
  + in a function-based index
  + as a DEFAULT clause of any DML statement
  + in the WHEN conditions of CASE
  + in the START WITH and CONNECT BY clauses
+ Correlated subquery: 
  + each row, execute parent query and then subquery. Parent query
    drives correlated subquery.
  + Correlated subquery in UPDATE and DELETE clauses
    + in SET and WHERE clauses
+ EXIST keyword: tests for the existence of any rows in a subquery.
+ WITH clause: assign a name to a subquery block (internally a
  temporary table or inline view).
